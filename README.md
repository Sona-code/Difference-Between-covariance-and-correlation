What  is the use of correlation over covariance?


Covariance tells you whether two variables tend to increase or decrease together. If one goes up when the other goes up, and down when the other goes down, they have positive covariance. If one goes up when the other goes down, and vice versa, they have negative covariance. However, the exact value of covariance doesn't have a standard scale, so it can be hard to interpret.

Correlation is similar to covariance but is scaled to always be between -1 and 1. It shows not only whether variables change together, but also the strength and direction of their relationship. A correlation of 1 means they have a perfect positive relationship, -1 means a perfect negative relationship, and 0 means there's no linear relationship between them.

Because correlation is easier to understand, compares relationships across different pairs of variables, and isn't affected by the units of measurement, it's often a more useful measure than covariance for describing how variables are related.
